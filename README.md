# Employee Productivity Analysis

Objective of this project is to analyze and visualize employee productivity metrics to uncover insights, identify performance trends, and support data-driven workforce optimization.

**Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Attribution:**
Dataset sourced from Kaggle: [Employee Performance and Productivity Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/employee-performance-and-productivity-data)  
CSV files located in `data/raw/` and cleaned data in `data/cleaned/`.

**Key Features and Analysis Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, normalize time tracking data, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute summary statistics for hours worked, task completion rates, and output quality scores.
3. **Visualization:** Generate trend plots, box plots, and heatmaps to explore productivity over time and across teams.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Build and evaluate a regression model to forecast future productivity levels (`models/productivity_model.pkl`).
5. **Reporting:** Export key findings to PowerPoint slides and interactive dashboards in Jupyter Notebook.

For detailed EDA and methodology, see `Analysis.ipynb`.
